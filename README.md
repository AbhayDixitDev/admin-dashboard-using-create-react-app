# Project Overview

Welcome to our React-based project! This application is designed to provide a dynamic and responsive user interface, utilizing the powerful combination of React, JSON Server, and Bootstrap. Whether you're a developer looking to understand the structure and functionality of our project, or a user interested in the capabilities of a React application, this README aims to guide you through the key components and features of our application.

## Features

- **Dynamic User Interface**: Built with React, our application offers a seamless and interactive user experience.
- **Backend Simulation**: Using JSON Server on port 4000, we mimic a real backend, allowing for a full-fledged development environment without the need for a separate server setup.
- **Responsive Design**: Integrated with Bootstrap, the application is fully responsive and ensures a great look on devices of all sizes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhayDixitDev/Admin-Dashboard-CRUD-React-JSON-Server
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run JSON Server**
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 4000
   ```
4. **Start the React Application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The JSON Server will be available at `http://localhost:4000`, where you can access the simulated backend data.
